Day 3 - Sorting Data with ORDER BY

Focus: ORDER BY, ASC/DESC, multi-column sorting

Learnings:

Learnings:
✅ Sorting by a single column: DESC shows highest values first, ASC shows lowest/earliest first.
✅ Sorting by multiple columns: SQL sorts sequentially — first column is primary, second breaks ties.
✅ NULL values usually appear first (ASC) or last (DESC).
✅ ORDER BY is usually the last clause in a query (except LIMIT).

✅ Practice Questions:

-- 1.List all patients sorted by age in descending order(oldest first).
select
*
from patients
order by age desc;

-- 2. Show all services_weekly data sorted by week number (earliest first) ascending and patients_request descending (highest first within week).
select
*
from services_weekly
order by week asc, patients_request desc;

-- 3. Display staff members sorted alphabetically by their names(A-Z).
select
*
from staff
order by staff_name asc;

-- Day 3  Question: Retrieve the top 5 weeks with the highest patient refusals across all services, showing week, service, patients_refused, and patients_request. 
-- Sort by patients_refused in descending order.

select
week,
service,
patients_refused,
patients_request
from services_weekly
order by patients_refused desc
limit 5 ;
