 Day 4 – LIMIT & OFFSET

Focus: Controlling result sets, pagination, and fetching specific slices of data.

✅ Learnings:

- LIMIT n restricts the number of rows returned.
- OFFSET n skips a specified number of rows before fetching results.
- LIMIT + OFFSET allows exploring large datasets in manageable chunks, fetching top-N records, or paginating results.
- LIMIT and OFFSET, especially when combined with ORDER BY, give precise control over large datasets, making analysis efficient and helping you focus on the records that matter most.

✅ Practice Questions:

-- 1.Display the first 5 patients from the patients table.
select
*
from patients
Limit 5;

-- 2.Show patients 11-20 using OFFSET.
select
*
from patients
order by patient_id
limit 10 offset 10;

-- 3.Get the 10 most recent patient admissions based on arrival_date.
SELECT patient_id, name, arrival_date
FROM patients
ORDER BY arrival_date DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- Day 4  Question:Find the 3rd to 7th highest patient satisfaction scores from the patients table, showing patient_id, name, service, and satisfaction.Display only these 5 records.

select
patient_id,
name,
service,
satisfaction 
from patients
order by satisfaction desc
Limit 5 offset 2;
