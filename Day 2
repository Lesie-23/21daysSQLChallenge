 # 💻 Day 2 of my 21 Days SQL Challenge – Filtering Data with the WHERE Clause

Today’s focus was on one of the most powerful tools in SQL — the **WHERE clause**.  
It’s what makes your queries smart, pulling out only the data that matters.

## A few takeaways I’m keeping in mind:

. The **WHERE** clause filters out the noise — you decide what data you actually want to see.
. Use **IN** instead of multiple ORs — cleaner, faster, easier to read.
. **BETWEEN** includes both ends (e.g. `WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65`). 
. Always use **single quotes** for text, not numbers.  
  - ✅ WHERE age = 50  
  - ✅ WHERE service = 'Surgery'
. Never use = NULL — it’s IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.
. Parentheses `()` are crucial when combining **AND** / **OR** to avoid logic errors.


 ## Pratice Questions:

-- 1.Find all patients who are older than 60 years.
select * from patients
where age > 60;

-- 2.Retrieve all staff members who work in the 'Emergency' service.
select * from staff
where service  = 'Emergency';

-- 3. List all weeks where more than 100 patients requested admission in any service.
select
	week,
	service,
	patients_request as total_patients
from services_weekly
where patients_request > 100
order by 
	week, patients_request desc;

-- Day 2  Question: Find all patients admitted to 'Surgery' service with a satisfaction score below 70, 
-- showing their patient_id, name, age, and satisfaction score.

select 
	patient_id,
	name,
	age,
	satisfaction as satisfaction_score
from patients
where service = 'Surgery' and satisfaction < 70;
