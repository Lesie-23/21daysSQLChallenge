Day 8 - STRING Functions
Focus: Transforming, cleaning, and extracting insights from text data within SQL queries.

✅ Learnings:

-String functions manipulate and standardize text data for analysis.
- UPPER() / LOWER() ensure consistent casing for comparison.
- LENGTH() measure text size to detect anomalies.
-CONCAT() or || combine multiple strings into one meaningful field.
- SUBSTRING() extracts portions of text, like codes or initials.
- TRIM() removes unwanted leading/trailing spaces.
- REPLACE() substitutes specific characters or words for cleaning.

✅ Practice Questions:

-- 1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
select
upper(name) as patient_name
from patients;

-- 2.Find the length of each staff member's name.
select
length(staff_name) as len_staff_name
from staff;

-- 3.Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
select
concat(staff_id, '-',staff_name) as staff_name_id
from staff;

-- 8 Question: Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, 
-- age category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. 
-- Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.

select
patient_id,
upper(name) as full_name,
lower(service) as service_name,
case
    when age >= 65 then 'Senior'
    when age >= 18 then 'Adult'
    else 'Minor'
end as age_category,
length(name) as name_length
from patients
where length(name) > 10;
