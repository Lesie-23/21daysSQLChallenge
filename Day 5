Day 5 – Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, ROUND)

Focus: Summarizing data and deriving insights through numerical calculations.

✅ Learnings:

-Alias your aggregates for readable column names.

* COUNT Functions:
- COUNT(*) → counts all rows (including NULLs)
- COUNT(column) → counts non-NULL values
- COUNT(DISTINCT column) → counts unique non-NULL values

* Numeric Aggregates:
- SUM(column) → total of numeric values
- AVG(column) → average of numeric values
- MIN(column) → minimum value
- MAX(column) → maximum value
- ROUND(column, n) → round numeric results to n decimals

✅ Practice Questions:

-- 1. Count the total number of patients in the hospital.
Select
count(patient_id) as total_number_of_patients
from patients;

-- 2.Calculate the average satisfaction score of all patients.
select
round(avg(satisfaction),2) as satisfaction_score
from patients;

-- 3.Find the minimum and maximum age of patients.
select
min(age) as min_age,
max(age) as max_age
from patients;

-- Day 5  Question: Calculate the total number of patients admitted, total patients refused, and the average patient satisfaction across all services and weeks. 
-- Round the average satisfaction to 2 decimal places.
select
sum(patients_admitted) as total_patients_admit,
sum(patients_refused) as total_patients_refuse,
round(avg(patient_satisfaction),2) as avg_patient_satisfied
from services_weekly;
