Day 16 – Subqueries in WHERE clause

Focus: Filtering rows using nested queries.

✅ Learnings:

- Single-value subqueries return one value (=, <, >).
- Multiple-value subqueries return lists (IN, NOT IN).
- EXISTS/NOT EXISTS checks for row existence.
- Correlated subqueries reference outer query columns.
- Test subqueries independently and handle NULLs carefully.

✅ Practice Questions:

-- 1. Find patients who are in services with above-average staff count.
select
patient_id,name, service 
from patients
where service in (
                 select service 
                 from staff
                 group by service
                 having count(staff_id) >
                 (select avg(staff_count) from (select count(staff_id) as staff_count from staff
                 group by service) as t)
                 );
                 
-- 2.List staff who work in services that had any week with patient satisfaction below 70.
select
*
from staff 
where service in (
           select service
            from services_weekly 
            where patient_satisfaction < 70);
            
-- 3. Show patients from services where total admitted patients exceed 1000.
select
name as patient_name,
service
from patients 
where service in (
            select service
            from services_weekly
            group by service
            having sum(patients_admitted) >1000);

/* Day 16 Question:Find all patients who were admitted to services that had at least one week where patients were refused 
AND the average patient satisfaction for that service was below the overall hospital average satisfaction. 
Show patient_id, name, service, and their personal satisfaction score.*/

SELECT
    patient_id,
    name,
    service,
    satisfaction AS satisfaction_score
FROM patients 
WHERE service IN (
    SELECT service
    FROM services_weekly
    GROUP BY service
    HAVING 
        SUM(CASE WHEN patients_refused > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
        AND
        AVG(patient_satisfaction) < (
            SELECT AVG(patient_satisfaction)
            FROM services_weekly
        )
);
