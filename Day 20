Day 20 – Window Functions: Aggregate Window Functions

Focus: Using aggregate window functions to calculate running totals, moving averages, and row-level comparisons without collapsing rows.

✅ Learnings:

- SUM() OVER → running totals
- AVG() OVER → moving averages
- ORDER BY in window → cumulative progression
- ROWS BETWEEN → precise moving/sliding window
- PARTITION BY → separate calculations per category
- Window functions keep all rows, unlike GROUP BY
- Cannot nest window functions, but can reference others in same SELECT
- Ideal for trends, cumulative metrics, and row vs. group comparisons

✅ ROWS BETWEEN frame options:

- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING → start from first row
- N PRECEDING → N rows before current
- CURRENT ROW → current row
- N FOLLOWING → N rows after current
- UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING → end at last row

✅ Practice Questions

-- 1.Calculate running total of patients admitted by week for each service.
select
week,
service,
patients_admitted,
sum(patients_admitted) over (partition by service order by week ) as cumulative_admissions
from services_weekly
order by service,week;

-- 2 .Find the moving average of patient satisfaction over 4-week periods.
select
	week,
	service,
	patient_satisfaction,
	round(avg(patient_satisfaction) over(partition by service order by week rows between 3 preceding and current row), 2) 
         as moving_avg_4week
from services_weekly
order by service,week;


-- 3.Show cumulative patient refusals by week across all services.
select
	week,
	sum(patients_refused),
	sum(sum(patients_refused)) over(order by week) as cumulative_patient_refusal
from services_weekly
group by week;


 /*. Day 20 Question: Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted, running total of patients admitted (cumulative), 
 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 prior weeks), and the difference between current week admissions and the service average.
 Filter for weeks 10-20 only.*/
 
 select
	week,
	service,
	patients_admitted,
	sum(patients_admitted) over (partition by service order by week ) as cumulative_admissions,
	round(avg(patient_satisfaction) over(partition by service order by week 
	rows between 2 preceding and current row), 2)  as moving_avg_3week,
	round(patients_admitted - avg(patients_admitted) over (partition by service),2) as difference_admission
from services_weekly
where week between 10 and  20
order by week, service;
