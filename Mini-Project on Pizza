Welcome to The Great Pizza Analytics Challenge, a SQL mini-project designed to strengthen database querying skills through structured exploration, filtering, and sales analysis.

This project is based on the IDC_Pizza database and covers 16 essential SQL problems across three phases — from foundational queries to detailed business insights.

 📊 Project Structure
- Phase 1 — Foundation & Inspection
Focus: Basic data exploration, NULL handling, distinct values.

- Phase 2 — Filtering & Exploration
Focus: WHERE conditions, pattern matching, ranges, and logical operators.

- Phase 3 — Sales Performance Analysis
Focus: Aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINs, and a self-join.

🗄 Database Overview
The IDC_Pizza database contains four key tables:
1. order_details
2.orders
3.pizza_types
4.pizzas

✅ SQL Questions & Answers
Below are the 16 SQL queries solved as part of the project.

-- 1 .List all unique pizza categories (DISTINCT).
select
distinct category as unique_pizza
from pizza_types;

-- 2. Display pizza_type_id, name, and ingredients, replacing NULL ingredients with "Missing Data". Show first 5 rows.
select
pizza_type_id,
name,
coalesce(ingredients, 'Missing Data') as Pizza_ingredients
from pizza_types
limit 5;

-- 3. Check for pizzas missing a price (IS NULL).
select
*
from pizzas
where price is null;

-- 4.Orders placed on '2015-01-01' (SELECT + WHERE).
select
*
from orders
where date = '2015-01-01';

-- 5.List pizzas with price descending.
select
*
from pizzas
order by price desc;

-- 6. Pizzas sold in sizes 'L' or 'XL'.
select 
pizza_type_id,
size,
price
from pizzas where size in('L', 'XL');

-- 7.Pizzas priced between $15.00 and $17.00.
select
*
from pizzas
where price between 15.00 and  17.00;

-- 8. Pizzas with "Chicken" in the name.
select
*
from pizza_types
where name like '%Chicken%';

-- 9. Orders on '2015-02-15' or placed after 8 PM.
select
*
from orders
where date ='2015-02-15' or time > '20:00:00';

-- 10. Total quantity of pizzas sold (SUM).
select
sum(quantity) as total_pizzas_sold
from order_details;

-- 11.Average pizza price (AVG).
select
round(avg(price),2) as avg_price
from pizzas;

-- 12.Total order value per order (JOIN, SUM, GROUP BY).
select
o.order_id,
sum(p.price * o.quantity) as total_order
from order_details as o
join pizzas as p
on o.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by o.order_id;

-- 13. Total quantity sold per pizza category (JOIN, GROUP BY).
select 
pt.category,
SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
from order_details o
join pizzas p 
on o.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_types pt 
on p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
group by pt.category;

-- 14. Categories with more than 5,000 pizzas sold (HAVING).
select 
pt.category, 
sum(o.quantity) as total_sold
from pizza_types pt
join pizzas p on pt.pizza_type_id = p.pizza_type_id
join order_details o on p.pizza_id = o.pizza_id
group by pt.category
having sum(o.quantity) > 5000;


-- 15.Pizzas never ordered (LEFT/RIGHT JOIN).
select 
p.pizza_id,
p.size,
p.price
from pizzas p
left join order_details o 
on p.pizza_id = o.pizza_id
where o.pizza_id is null;

-- 16.Price differences between different sizes of the same pizza (SELF JOIN).
select
p1.pizza_id,
p1.size as size1,
p1.price as price1,
p2.size as size2,
p2.price as price2,
(p2.price - p1.price) as price_difference
from pizzas p1
join pizzas p2
on p1.pizza_type_id = p2.pizza_type_id
and p1.size < p2.size
order by p1.pizza_id,size1,size2;
