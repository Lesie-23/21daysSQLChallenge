Day 12 – NULL Handling

Focus: Understanding and managing NULLs with IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, and COALESCE.

✅ Key Points

- NULL = missing or unknown data (not 0 or empty string)
- Check for NULLs:
    - IS NULL → selects rows where value is missing
    - IS NOT NULL → selects rows where value exists
- Replace NULLs: COALESCE(col, default) returns the first non-NULL value
- Aggregations: COUNT ignores NULLs; SUM/AVG skip NULLs
- Grouping/Sorting: All NULLs form one group; sorting may place NULLs first or last
- Best Practice: Store missing data as NULL consistently and handle explicitly in queries

✅ Practice Questions

-- 1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
select
week
from services_weekly
where event is null or  event = 'none';

-- 2.Count how many records have null or empty event values.
select
count(*) as null_event_values
from services_weekly
where event is null or  event = 'none';

-- 3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.
select
distinct service
from services_weekly
where event is  not null and event <> 'none';


  /* Day 12 Question: Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, 
average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.*/

Select
case
   when event is null or event = 'none' then 'No Event'
   else 'With event'
end as event_status,
count(*) as total_weeks,
round(avg(patient_satisfaction),1) as avg_patient_satisfaction,
round(avg(staff_morale),1) as avg_staff_morale
from services_weekly
group by event_status
order by avg_patient_satisfaction desc;
